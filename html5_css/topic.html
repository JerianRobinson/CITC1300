    <h2>Deathwing</h2>
    <p>The Deathwing is the First Company of the Dark Angels and their current chapter master is Belial.The Deathwing was formed mainly from the remains of the Host of Crowns of the Unification and the Great Crusade First Legion. This Host was famed for its line breaking and marksmen abilities, and those of its Inner Circle who survived an infamous swore oaths that no member of the wing would ever leave the field of battle in the hands of the enemy, accepting death over dishonor or retreat. During the Horus Heresy they acted as a special operations unit specializing in not only line-breaking but also as elite veteran infantry and honor guards.</p>
    <h2>Ravenwing</h2>
    <p>The Ravenwing is the Second Company of the Dark Angels and their current chapter master is Sammael. The Ravenwings formation is specialized in where speed is more important than heavy firepower. To this end, all of the marines in the company ride into battle on Bikes or Land Speeders on land. In the air, the Ravenwing employs Dark Talons and Nephilim Jetfighters. The Ravenwing's hidden role within the chapter is that of mobile hunters, eternally prowling for their traitorous ancestors known as The Fallen. </p>
    <h2>Librarians</h2>
    <p>A Librarium or Librarius is the command and communications center of a Space Marine Chapter's fortress-monastery, and the repository for centuries of wisdom and history, culled from the reports, treatises and memoirs of the chapter's greatest warriors and finest minds. Librarians hold a functionary rank, describing their role as well as their position. The four battlefield ranks of Librarian, in ascending order of importance, are Lexicanium, Codicier, Epistolary and Chief Librarian. Each of these enters battle ready to support his brothers with a range of psychic attacks and defences.</p>
